# Stock-Twitz-Predictor

## Introduction
When deciding the value of a company, it's important to follow the news. For example, a product recall or a natural disaster in a company's product chain. You want to be able to turn this information into a signal. Currently, the best tool for the job is a Neural Network. 

For this project, I'll use posts from the social media site [StockTwits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StockTwits). The community on StockTwits is full of investors, traders, and entrepreneurs. Each message posted is called a Twit. This is similar to Twitter's version of a post, called a Tweet. I'll build a model around these tweets that generates a sentiment score.
